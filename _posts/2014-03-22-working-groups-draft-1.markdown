We've posted an initial draft of the working groups we'll need to get rolling with OADA.  

You can find it here as
a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YANKSAnxbqt8CgeumTAvMCK6O5o_-Uj_J-kLjTDFPe0/edit?usp=sharing">Google Doc with comments enabled</a>.

Have a look, tell your friends, make comments in-line on the Google Doc, or discuss it on the mailing list in 
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/oada-dev/dcE1gSPthA4">this dedicated thread</a>.

If you are interested in participating with a particular working group, please either email Aaron (<a href="mailto:aaron@openag.io">aaron@openag.io</a>),
or post to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/oada-dev/dcE1gSPthA4">working groups thread</a> on the oada-dev mailing list.  In the email, please include your:

- name, 
- background, 
- and groups you'd like to be a part of.

Thanks to all who have joined the community!
