Since we've been mentioning the OADA Privacy and Use Components in some of our OADA talks, I thought it would be a good idea to post a link 
on the blog in addition to the existing mailing list thread.  

For reference, here is a link to the current OADA Privacy and Use Components document in Google Docs:

and the mailing list thread for comments/suggestions:
