            <p><strong>The central guiding principle of OADA is that 
          each farmer owns data generated or entered by the farmer, their employees, or by machines performing 
          activities on their farm.</strong>  </p><p>By enabling interoperability through secure, public API’s for transferring 
          and using data, farmers will be free to choose cloud providers they trust while retaining control 
          over who can use their data.  The OADA community is building a set of open API’s for securely using data with the cloud.  
          Anyone can use these API’s in their own cloud systems, and if they pass the same software tests 
          as the open reference implementation, they will be considered technically compliant.  Community 
          guidelines are also being developed outlining data privacy and use standards that will be used 
          to define levels of OADA compliance.</p>
