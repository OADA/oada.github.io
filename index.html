      <div class="panel"> <div class="site-desc"><p>The Open Ag Data Alliance is an open source project designed to bring interoperability, security, and privacy to agricultural data.  The central guiding principle of OADA is that each farmer owns data generated or entered by the farmer, their employees, or by machines performing activities on their farm.  By enabling interoperability through secure, public API’s for transferring and using data, farmers will be free to choose cloud providers they trust while retaining control of who can use their data.</p>
      
         
<p>The OADA community is building a set of open API’s for securely using data with the cloud.  Anyone can use these API’s in their own cloud systems, and if they pass the same software tests as the open reference implementation, they will be considered technically compliant.  Community guidelines are also being developed outlining data privacy and use standards that will be used to define levels of OADA compliance.</p></div>
